<p>I made my own framework using flexbox, mostly for my own personal use. It makes my workflow faster</p>
<p>Building it helped me learn flexbox and css in general, and that's really what the main purpose is. It's just to help me learn and to make each website a little easier to build than the one before. It's not meant to be perfect or better than any other framework.</p>
